## Welcome!

If you're new to this sort of stuff or coming back to it after mobile/backend
development, here is a recommended workflow:

1. Install VS Code.

2. Install the Prettier and ESLint extensions.

3. Enable the VS Code setting to format on save.

4. Install node on your machine `brew install node`. Our package manager, `yarn`
   comes with it.

That's it. Enjoy coding!
